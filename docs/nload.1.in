.SH DESCRIPTION
.B nload
is a console application which monitors network traffic and bandwidth usage in real time.
It visualizes the in- and outgoing traffic using two graphs and provides additional info
like the total amount of transfered data and min/max network usage.

.SH USAGE
When running
.B nload,
you can switch between the devices (which you gave
.B nload
on the command line) by pressing the left and right arrow keys. If the -m command line
parameter is given, the arrow keys switch as many devices back and forth as there are shown
on the screen.
If you want to quit, do so by pressing 'q', 'Q' or Ctrl+C.

.SH OPTIONS
A summary of the options supported by
.B nload
is included below.

.TP
.B \-i max_scaling
Specifies the 100% mark in kBit/s of the graph indicating the incoming bandwidth usage.
Ignored if max_scaling is 0 or the switch -m is given. The default value for max_scaling
is 10240.
.TP
.B \-m
Show multiple devices at a time; do not show the traffic graphs.
.TP
.B \-o max_scaling
Same as -i but for the graph indicating the outgoing bandwidth usage.
.TP
.B \-s smoothness
Sets the "smoothness" of the average in/out values.
A value of 1 means little smoothness (average over a short period of time), a value of 9
means high smoothness (average over a long period of time). The default is 9.
.TP
.B \-t interval
Determines the refresh interval of the display in milliseconds.
If interval is 0 print net load only one time and exit.
The default value of interval is 500.

PLEASE NOTE:
Specifying refresh intervals shorter than about 200 milliseconds makes traffic
calculation very unprecise. Also the display may flicker using such short
refresh intervals.
.B nload
tries to balance this out by doing extra time measurements, but this may
not always succeed.
.TP
.B \-u h|H|b|B|k|K|m|M|g|G
Sets the type of unit used for the display of traffic numbers.
h means human readable (auto), b Bit/s, k kBit/s, m MBit/s and g GBit/s.
The upper case letters mean the corresponding units in Bytes (instead of Bits).
The default is k.
.TP
.B \-U h|H|b|B|k|K|m|M|g|G
Same as -u, but for an amount of data, e.g. Bit, kByte, GBit etc. (without "/s").
The default is M.
.TP
.B devices
Network devices to use. The default device is "eth0".
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Show a short summary of these command line options.

.SH FILES
.I /proc/net/dev
is read by nload to get the network traffic data.

.SH VERSION
This is version @VERSION@ of nload.
