nload 0.3.0 (2001-09-25)
real time monitor for network traffic
Copyright (C) 2001 by Roland Riegel <support@roland-riegel.de>

1. Introduction
   ------------

This is version 0.3.0 of nload, a console application which monitors network
traffic and bandwidth usage in real time.
It visualizes the in- and outgoing traffic using two graphs and provides
additionally info like total amount of transfered data
and min/max network usage.

2. Installing / Compiling nload
   ----------------------------

Compiling is done by running

./configure
make

in the directory where this README is.
To install nload, you have to be root:

su
make install

You can find more detailed information in the file INSTALL in this directory.

3. Using nload
   -----------

To learn about the command line switches of nload, simply run:

nload --help

When running nload, you can switch between the devices (which you gave nload
on the command line) by pressing the left and right arrow keys.
If you want to quit, do so by pressing 'q', 'Q' or Ctrl+C.

PLEASE NOTE:
Specifying refresh intervals shorter than about 200 milliseconds makes traffic
calculation very unprecise. Also the display may flicker using such short
refresh intervals.
nload tries to balance this out by doing extra time measurements, but this may
not always succeed.

4. Uninstalling nload
   ------------------

If you want to uninstall nload (I hope you never don't want to ;-), run:

make uninstall

in the build directory.
